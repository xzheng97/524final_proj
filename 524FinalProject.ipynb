    "### 2.1 Markowitz Mean- Variance Portfolio Theory###\n",
    "Markowitz Mean- Variance Portfolio Theory, also known as **MPT**(Modern Portfolio Theory), was first introduced by Economist Harry Markowitz in a 1952 paper, which let him won a Nobel Prize in Economics later. The model aims to assemble a portfolio of assets such that the risk level is minimized while still maintaining at a certain amount of baseline return, where the risk is measured by the variance of asset prices. The key idea behind the model is that an asset's risk and return should not be determined by its own but its contribution towards the overall risk and return as the whole portfolio.\n",
    "#### Assumptions####\n",
    "Here we list the assumptions that MPT makes about the market and the investors.\n",
    "1. investors are identical: they are risk-averse and rational\n",
    "2. investors decide solely on their expected returns and risk\n",
    "3. asset returns stay the same over time\n",
    "4. investors have information about all the asset price that they consider for investment, and  they are allowed to update their porfolio instantly without any additional cost\n",
    "5. asset price are not affected by investors' choices\n",
    "6. any size of trades can be made on all asets\n",
    "7. investors spend all their money into their portfolio\n",
    "8. investors can take short positions on assets #TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portfolio Return Rates####\n",
    "If we bought an asset with $x_0$ dollars on one day and then sell it for $x_1$ dollars, then the ratio $R = {x_1 \\over x_0}$ represents the **return** on the asset. And the **rate of return** is denoted as $r = {{x_1 - x_0} \\over x_0} = R - 1$. <br><br>\n",
    "Now consider we invest n assets at the begining with $x_0$ dollars. For each asset $i$, we assign $w_ix_0$ to it, where $w_i$ is the weighting factor to asset $i$. Since the weighting factor would sum to 1, we have the constraint\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} w_ix_0 = x_0 $$\n",
    "Let $R_i$ represents the return on asset i, then the total return that we can gain from the portfolio is\n",
    "$$ x_1 = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} R_iw_ix_0 = x_0 \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}R_iw_i$$\n",
    "Let $r_i$ represents the rate of return on asset i, then the rate of return of our portfolio is\n",
    "$$r = R - 1 = {{x_0 \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}R_iw_i} \\over x_0} - 1= \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}R_iw_i - \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_i =\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(R_i-1)w_i = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_iw_i $$\n",
    "#### Basic Model####\n",
    "Let $z = \\begin{bmatrix} r_1\\\\ r_2\\\\...\\\\r_n\\end{bmatrix}$. We denote the **expected return** for asset i by $\\mu_i = E[r_i],m = (\\mu_1,\\mu_2,...,\\mu_n)^T$and the **(true) covariances** of asset returns as $\\Sigma = E[(z-\\mu)(z-\\mu)^T]$.<br><br>\n",
    "Since $r_i$ is described as random variables in the MPT model, the rate of return of our portfolio $r = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_iw_i $ is also a random variable with mean $m^Tw$ and variance $w^T\\Sigma w$. If $\\mu_b$ is set to be the baseline return for our portfolio, then the MPT model can be built as a quadratic program:\n",

    "<p>In the traditional MTP, it needs two estimates variables: estimates of expected returns and estimates of covariace of those returns. The way that traditional MTP uses to estimates those two variables is using the average monthly returns of the given period of time. In formula, $\\mu = \\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T \\mathbf{r_t}$ and $\\Sigma =  \\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T[\\mathbf{r_t}\\mathbf{r_t}^\\intercal] - \\mu\\mu^\\intercal$, where $\\mathbf{r_t}$ is the vector of all assests' returns between time t and t-1. </p>\n",
    "<p>    By analyzing the estimation methods, we found that they are very sensitive to $\\mathbf{r_t}$, thus any extreme returns in any month would have huge impact on our estimation of the expected return. So in our second model, we want to improve the traditional MTP model by using other ways of estimation for expected returns and covariance matrix.</p>\n",
    "1. How to improve $\\mu$<br>\n",
    "Instead of using mean of monthly returns $\\mu = \\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T \\mathbf{r_t}$ to estimate expected return, we have two ways to improve out estimation.\n",
    "    * We can jettison the h% extreme values and calculate the mean after discarding those values.\n",

    "2. How to improve $\\Sigma$ <br>\n",
    "There are three disadvantages for the traditional estimation of covariance matrix: \n",
    "    1. it is very sensitive to the extreme value of $\\mathbf{r_t}$, \n",
    "    2. If we want to add a new stock into our list, we need to update the stock's variance and covariance with every other stocks in out list which is very computational. \n",
    "    3. The time period of original model requires at least n months. In the contrast, if we can use some other methods like linear estimation then we can run our model with data in more than two months.\n",

    "To reduce the workload of computing covariance matrix and get a more precise estimation. We will build a relationship between each stock with the market index. We will use $r_m$ to denote the market return. Then for every $r_i$, it can be expressed as $r_i = r_m + \\tilde{\\mathcal r_i}$ where $\\tilde{\\mathcal r_i}$ represents the excess return beyond the market. We assume there is a linear relationship between every stocks' excess returns and the market return, which is\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{\\mathcal r_{i,t}} = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i r_{m,t} + \\epsilon_{i,t} \\text{ for i = 1,...,N and t = 1,...,T}$$\n",
    "In this formula, we need to estimate $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ for each stock thus we only need 2N variables to estimate and it is much less than the model in part 2.1. $\\epsilon_{i,t}$ is error term with $\\mathbf{E}[\\epsilon_i] = 0$ and Cov[$\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon_j$]=0,$\\forall j \\ne i$.<br>\n",
    "To solve the OLS estimates, we will use ClpSolver to get the estimates of $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ for each stock i.<br>\n",
    "After we get the OLS estimates for each stock, we can have two formulas for estimates stock's variance and covariance between two stocks:\n",
    "$$Var[\\tilde{\\mathcal r_i}] = {\\beta_i}^2{\\sigma_m}^2 + {\\sigma_{\\epsilon_i}}^2$$,\n",
    "$$ Cov[\\tilde{\\mathcal r_i}, \\tilde{\\mathcal r_j}] = {\\beta_i}{\\beta_j}{\\sigma_m}^2$$\n",
    "where ${\\sigma_m} = Var[r_m]$. Thus, by adding a bias-correction term, we can get our estimated covariance matrix, which is:\n",
    "$$ \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\intercal {\\sigma_m}^2 + \\frac{T-1}{T-2}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma_{\\epsilon}} $$\n",
